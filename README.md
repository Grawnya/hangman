# Hangman

# Introduction

# Project Aim

# UX

## User Goals
* Easy to navigate around
* All content remains centrally located on the device screen
* Quick flowing game with no interruptions or slow loading times
* Simple change between light and dark mode
* Clear knowledge of which letters pressed are right or wrong

## User Stories
* As a user, I want to easily interact with the game.
* As a user, I want to know how to play the game.
* As a user, I want to play a game that is not slow to run.
* As a user, I want to know if the letter I selected is in the word or not in the game.

## User Requirements and Expectations
### Requirements
* Easy to navigate on the different screen sizes – mobile, tablet and larger screens.
* Present basic introductory sentence to play the game.
* Let the user know if the letter they select is contained within the word or not.
* Entice the user to play again with aesthetically pleasing modal boxes.

### Expectations
* I expect the game to flow nicely with a clear, logical progression of the game.
* I expect the website to be completely responsive to all screen sizes
* I expect to set up the form if the user wins, so that it has to be correctly filled out in order for it to be successfully submitted and used to manipulate the DOM.
* I expect the user to utilise the dark/light mode functionality of the website throughout the game.

## Design Choices
### Font
To deviate from the standard fonts, [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") was used to obtain a font style, which would be reminiscent of a classroom blackboard. [Pangolin]( https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pangolin?query=pangolin) fulfilled the criteria for the game’s text, as it was easily readable, yet had that nostalgic childhood vibe.

### Icons
In order to obtain some icons for the website, [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome") will be utilised. An icon is only required for the dark/light mode button as the hangman images are all pictures.
